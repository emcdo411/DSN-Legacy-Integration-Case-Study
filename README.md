# DSN-Legacy-Integration-Case-Study

Welcome to the **DSN-Legacy-Integration-Case-Study** repository! This project presents a data-driven case study prepared for Software Development Manager Jesus Garcia, exploring the integration of legacy dental systems (Btrieve, Pervasive SQL, DBISAM, Sybase) with DSN Cloud, a modern cloud-based dental practice management software, using no-code/low-code (NCLC) platforms and middleware solutions.

## [Summary](#summary)

This case study, authored by Maurice McDonald, Data Viz Storyteller, on June 7, 2025, at 08:19 AM CDT, investigates the challenges and strategies for integrating legacy dental systems with DSN Cloud. It evaluates middleware options like BTR2SQL, Flowgear, CData Drivers, Progress DataDirect, and DbVisualizer, analyzes the persistence of legacy systems, and proposes a hybrid integration approach with NCLC platforms. Visualizations using R and ggplot2 provide data-driven insights into adoption rates, persistence factors, integration success, and cost/time estimates.

## [Why This Matters](#why-this-matters)

This project addresses a critical intersection of healthcare technology and legacy infrastructure, directly impacting DSN Cloud's market competitiveness and patient care delivery. The persistence of legacy systems like Btrieve and Sybase in dental practices, driven by high costs and vendor lock-in, represents a $2 billion annual challenge in the dental software sector (per Dental Economics, 2025). Integrating these with modern NCLC platforms via middleware not only reduces migration costs by up to 95% (as shown with BTR2SQL) but also enhances data security, addressing the 90% breach rate in legacy systems (HHS 2024). For DSN, this means unlocking new revenue streams, improving workflow efficiency by 75% (Flowgear data), and aligning with the growing demand for cloud-based solutions, projected to grow at a 12% CAGR through 2030 (MarketsandMarkets). This case study provides a roadmap to balance innovation with practicality, ensuring DSN remains a leader in dental tech.

## [Conclusion](#conclusion)

Middleware options—BTR2SQL, Flowgear, CData drivers, Progress DataDirect, and DbVisualizer—offer viable integration paths for DSN’s legacy systems with NCLC platforms. Visualizations highlight adoption (70-80%), persistence factors (40% cost-driven), success rates (70-95%), and costs ($5,000-$20,000), challenging the oversimplified cloud narrative. A hybrid approach, leveraging middleware for secure, efficient integration, is recommended for DSN’s next development phase, balancing innovation with stability.

## [Notes](#notes)

- **Graphs Placement**: Each visualization is positioned under the relevant section, aligning with the data presented (e.g., adoption rates under middleware options, cost/time under feasibility).
- **Color Scheme**: Uses `#000000` (black), `#404040` (dark grey), `#808080` (medium grey), `#ADD8E6` (light blue) for a professional look.
- **Latitude/Longitude Lines**: Dashed grey lines simulate a geopolitical grid, scaled to each graph.
- **RStudio Compatibility**: Requires `ggplot2` (install with `install.packages("ggplot2")`).
- **Data Sources**: Based on industry estimates, vendor reports, HHS 2024, and Dental Economics 2025, with approximations where exact figures are unavailable.
